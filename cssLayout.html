                    <h2>About</h2>

                    <p> Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed mainly
                        from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira
                        (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and
                        recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found
                        on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles,
                        birds, and mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.

                    <h2>Shell</h2>
                    <img src="IMAGES/Turtles/shell.png" alt="turtle shell">
                    <p>
                        The shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide
                        shelter from the elements. It is primarily made of 50â€“60 bones and consists of two parts: the domed, dorsal (back) carapace
                        and the flatter, ventral (belly) plastron. They are connected by lateral (side) extensions of the plastron. The carapace is fused with the
                        vertebrae and ribs while the plastron is formed from bones of the shoulder girdle, sternum, and gastralia (abdominal ribs). During
                        development, the ribs grow sideways into a carapacial ridge, unique to turtles, entering the dermis (inner skin) of the back to support the carapace. The
                        development is signaled locally by proteins known as fibroblast growth factors that include FGF10. The shoulder girdle in turtles is made up of
                        two bones, the scapula and the coracoid. Both the shoulder and pelvic girdles of turtles are located within the shell and hence are effectively
                        within the rib cage. The trunk ribs grow over the shoulder girdle during development.

                    <p>
                        Most turtle species are opportunistic omnivores; land-dwelling species are more herbivorous and
                        aquatic ones more carnivorous. Generally lacking speed and agility, most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals
                        with limited movements like mollusks, worms, and insect larvae. Some species, such as the African helmeted turtle and snapping turtles, eat fish,
                        amphibians, reptiles (including other turtles), birds, and mammals. They may take them by ambush but also scavenge. The alligator snapping
                        turtle has a worm-like appendage on its tongue that it uses to lure fish into its mouth. Tortoises are the most herbivorous group, consuming
                        grasses, leaves, and fruits. Many turtle species, including tortoises, supplement their diet with eggshells, animal bones, hair, and droppings for extra
                        nutrients. Turtles generally eat their food in a straightforward way, though some species have special
                        feeding techniques.

                        Turtles make use of vision to find food and mates, avoid predators, and orient themselves.
                        The retina's light-sensitive cells include both rods for vision in low light, and cones with
                        three different photopigments for bright light, where they have full-color vision. There is possibly a
                        fourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet, as hatchling sea turtles respond experimentally to
                        ultraviolet light, but it is unknown if they can distinguish this from longer wavelengths. A freshwater turtle, the
                        red-eared slider, has an exceptional seven types of cone cell. Sea turtles orient themselves on land by
                        night, using visual features detected in dim light. They can use their eyes in clear surface water, muddy
                        coasts, the darkness of the deep ocean, and also above water. Unlike in terrestrial turtles, the cornea (the
                        curved surface that lets light into the eye) does not help to focus light on the retina, so focusing
                        underwater is handled entirely by the lens, behind the cornea.
