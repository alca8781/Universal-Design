            Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African
            bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant
            (Elephas maximus). <br><br>
            They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct
            relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called
            a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is
            prehensile,
            bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth,
            serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining
            a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave
            backs,
            whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. <br><br>

            Elephants are scattered throughout
            sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in
            different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay
            near water
            when it is accessible.<br><br>

            They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their
            environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to
            socialise. <br><br>

            Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
            related
            females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.
            Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males.
            Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased
            testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as
            reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers
            for as long as
            three
            years. <br><br>

            Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound;
            elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been
            compared with
            that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and possibly show concern for dying and
            dead
            individuals of their kind.<br><br>
            African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African
            forest elephants as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One
            of the biggest
            threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other
            threats to
            wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working
            animals
            in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos,
            or employed for entertainment in circuses. Elephants have an iconic status in human culture and have been
            widely featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.

<section class="etymology">
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        The word elephant is derived from the Latin word elephas (genitive elephantis) 'elephant', which is the
        Latinised form of the ancient Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos)), probably from a
        non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive
        e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean
        ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal. The word elephant appears in Middle
        English as olyfaunt (c.1300) and was borrowed from Old French oliphant (12th century).

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <div class="tax">
        <p>
            Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea. Their
            closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the
            clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria.[6] Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the
            clade Tethytheria.Three species of living elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta
            africana), forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). African elephants
            were traditionally
            considered a single species, Loxodonta africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as
            separate species.Mammoths (Mammuthus) are nested within living elephants as they are more closely
            related to Asian elephants than to African elephants.[12] Another extinct genus of elephant, Palaeoloxodon,
            is also
            recognised, which appears to have close affinities with African elephants and to have hybridised with
            African forest elephants.

<section class="evolution">
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        Over 180 extinct members of order Proboscidea have been described.The earliest proboscideans, the African
        Eritherium and Phosphatherium are
        known from the late Paleocene. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa.
        These animals were relatively
        small and, some, like Moeritherium and Barytherium were probably amphibious. Later on, genera such as Phiomia
        and Palaeomastodon arose;
        the latter likely inhabited more forested areas. Proboscidean diversification changed little during the
        Oligocene.
        One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, which may have been
        an ancestor to several later
        species. A major event in proboscidean evolution was the collision of Afro-Arabia with Eurasia, during the Early
        Miocene, around 18–19 million
        years ago, allowing proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland across Eurasia and later, around 16–15
        million years ago into North
        America across the Bering Land Bridge. Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene include the deinotheres,
        along with the more advanced
        elephantimorphs, including mammutids (mastodons), gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the "shovel
        tuskers" like Platybelodon),
        choerolophodontids and stegodontids. Around 10 million years ago, the earliest members of the family
        Elephantidae emerged in Africa,
        having originated from gomphotheres. Elephantids are distinguished from earlier proboscideans by a major shift
        in the molar morphology to
        parallel lophs rather than the cusps of earlier proboscideans, allowing them to become higher-crowned
        (hypsodont) and more efficient in
        consuming grass. The Late Miocene saw major climactic changes, which resulted in the decline and extinction of
        many proboscidean groups.
        The earliest members of the modern genera of Elephantidae appeared during the latest Miocene–early Pliocene
        around 5 million years ago. The elephantid
        genera Elephas (which includes the living Asian elephant) and Mammuthus (mammoths) migrated out of Africa during
        the late Pliocene, around
        3.6 to 3.2 million years ago. Over the course of the Early Pleistocene, all non-elephantid probobscidean genera
        outside of the Americas became
        extinct with the exception of Stegodon, with gomphotheres dispersing into South America as part of the Great
        American interchange, and mammoths
        migrating into North America around 1.5 million years ago.[26] At the end of the Early Pleistocene, around
        800,000 years ago the elephantid genus
        Palaeoloxodon dispersed outside of Africa, becoming widely distributed in Eurasia. Proboscideans were
        represented by around 23 species at the
        beginning of the Late Pleistocene. Proboscideans underwent a dramatic decline during the Late Pleistocene as
        part of the Late Pleistocene extinctions
        of most large mammals globally, with all remaining non-elephantid proboscideans (including Stegodon, mastodons,
        and the American gomphotheres Cuvieronius
        and Notiomastodon) and Palaeoloxodon becoming extinct, with mammoths only surviving in relict populations on
        islands around the Bering Strait into the
        Holocene, with their latest survival being on Wrangel Island, where they persisted until around 4,000 years ago.
        Over the course of
        their evolution, probobscideans grew in size. With that came longer limbs and wider feet with a more digitigrade
        stance, along with a larger head and
        shorter neck. The trunk evolved and grew longer to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors, and canines
        decreased, and the cheek teeth
        (molars and premolars) became longer and more specialised. The incisors developed into tusks of different shapes
        and sizes. Several species
        of proboscideans became isolated on islands and experienced insular dwarfism, some dramatically reducing in body
        size,
        such as the 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall dwarf elephant species Palaeoloxodon falconeri.

<section class="Anatomy">
    <p>
        Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. Some species of the extinct elephant genus
        Palaeoloxodon considerably exceeded modern elephants in size making them among the largest land mammals
        ever.[32] The
        skeleton is made up of 326–351 bones.[36] The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the
        backbone's
        flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.[37] The
        skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength.
        These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. By contrast, the lower jaw is dense.
        The
        cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire
        head.[36] The skull is built to withstand great stress, particularly when fighting or using the tusks. The
        brain is surrounded by arches in the skull, which serve as protection.[38] Because of the size of the head, the
        neck is relatively short to provide better support.[29] Elephants are homeotherms and maintain their average
        body
        temperature at ~ 36 °C (97 °F), with a minimum of 35.2 °C (95.4 °F) during the cool season, and a maximum of
        38.0 °C (100.4 °F) during the hot dry season.[39]

    <h3> Ears and eyes</h3>
    <div class="ears">
        <img src="IMAGES/ears400x266.png" alt="elephant ears">
        <p>
            Elephant ear flaps, or pinnae, are 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) thick in the middle with a thinner tip and
            supported by a thicker base. They contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood flows into
            the capillaries, releasing excess heat into the environment. This effect is increased by flapping the ears
            back and forth. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the
            elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates and have the largest ear flaps. The
            ossicles are adapted for hearing low frequencies, being most sensitive at 1 kHz.

            Lacking a lacrimal apparatus (tear duct), the eye relies on the harderian gland in the orbit to keep it
            moist. A durable nictitating membrane shields the globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the
            location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are dichromats and they can see well in dim
            light but not in bright light.

        "Elephant trunk" redirects here. For other uses, see Elephant trunk (disambiguation).

        African bush elephant with its trunk raised, a behaviour often adopted when trumpeting
        The elongated and prehensile trunk, or proboscis, consists of both the nose and upper lip, which fuse in
        early fetal development. This versatile appendage contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles, with
        no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal.
        The former are divided into dorsal, ventral, and lateral muscles, while the latter are divided into
        transverse and radiating muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The nasal
        septum consists of small elastic muscles between the nostrils, which are divided by cartilage at the
        base. A unique proboscis nerve – a combination of the maxillary and facial nerves – lines each side of
        the appendage.

        As a muscular hydrostat, the trunk moves through finely controlled muscle contractions, working both with
        and against each other. Using three basic movements: bending, twisting, and longitudinal stretching or
        retracting, the trunk has near unlimited flexibility. Objects grasped by the end of the trunk can be moved
        to the mouth by curving the appendage inward. The trunk can also bend at different points by creating
        stiffened "pseudo-joints". The tip can be moved in a way similar to the human hand. The skin is more
        elastic on the dorsal side of the elephant trunk than underneath; allowing the animal to stretch and coil
        while maintaining a strong grasp. The African elephants have two finger-like extensions at the tip of
        the trunk that allow them to pluck small food. The Asian elephant has only one and relies more on wrapping
        around a food item. Asian elephant trunks have better motor coordination.

        Asian elephant drinking water with trunk
        The trunk's extreme flexibility allows it to forage and wrestle other elephants with it. It is powerful
        enough to lift up to 350 kg (770 lb), but it also has the precision to crack a peanut shell without breaking
        the seed. With its trunk, an elephant can reach items up to 7 m (23 ft) high and dig for water in the mud or
        sand below. It also uses it to clean itself.[49] Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with
        their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right.[46] Elephant trunks are capable of
        powerful siphoning. They can expand their nostrils by 30%, leading to a 64% greater nasal volume, and can
        breathe in almost 30 times faster than a human sneeze, at over 150 m/s (490 ft/s). They suck up water,
        which is squirted into the mouth or over the body. The trunk of an adult Asian elephant is capable
        of retaining 8.5 L (2.2 US gal) of water. They will also sprinkle dust or grass on themselves. When
        underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel.

        The trunk also acts as a sense organ. Its sense of smell may be four times greater than a bloodhound's
        nose. The infraorbital nerve, which makes the trunk sensitive to touch, is thicker than both the optic
        and auditory nerves. Whiskers grow all along the trunk, and are particularly packed at the tip, where they
        contribute to its tactile sensitivity. Unlike those of many mammals, such as cats and rats, elephant
        whiskers do not move independently ("whisk") to sense the environment; the trunk itself must move to bring
        the whiskers into contact with nearby objects. Whiskers grow in rows along each side on the ventral surface
        of the trunk, which is thought to be essential in helping elephants balance objects there, whereas they are
        more evenly arranged on the dorsal surface. The number and patterns of whiskers are distinctly different
        between species.

        Damaging the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals
        have survived with shortened ones. One trunkless elephant has been observed to graze using its lips with its
        hind legs in the air and balancing on its front knees. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk
        paralysis recorded in African bush elephants and involves the degeneration of the peripheral nerves and
        muscles. The disorder has been linked to lead poisoning.

    <h3> teeth</h3>
    <p>
        Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks; 12 deciduous premolars; and 12 molars.
        Unlike most mammals, teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically. Instead, new
        teeth start at the back of the mouth and push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the
        jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. This is followed by four more tooth replacements
        at the ages of four to six, 9–15, 18–28, and finally in their early 40s. The final (usually sixth) set must
        last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are more
        diamond-shaped in African elephants.[55]
    </p>


    <h3> tusks</h3>
    <p>
        The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous milk teeth at
        6–12 months of age and keep growing at about 17 cm (7 in) a year. As the tusk develops, it is topped with
        smooth, cone-shaped enamel that eventually wanes. The dentine is known as ivory and has a cross-section of
        intersecting lines, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped patterns. Being living tissue,
        tusks are fairly soft and about as dense as the mineral calcite. The tusk protrudes from a socket in the
        skull, and most of it is external. At least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp, and some have nerves
        that stretch even further. Thus, it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When
        removed, ivory will dry up and crack if not kept cool and wet. Tusks function in digging, debarking,
        marking, moving objects, and fighting.[56]

        Elephants are usually right- or left-tusked, similar to humans, who are typically right- or left-handed. The
        dominant, or "master" tusk, is typically more worn down, as it is shorter and blunter. For African
        elephants, tusks are present in both males and females and are around the same length in both sexes,
        reaching up to 300 cm (9 ft 10 in),[56] but those of males tend to be more massive.[57] In the Asian
        species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all.[56] Tuskless
        males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants.[58] Asian males can have tusks as long
        as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was 302 cm (9 ft 11 in) long
        and weighed 39 kg (86 lb). Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa[59] and Asia[60] has resulted in an
        effective selection pressure for shorter tusks[61][62] and tusklessness.[63][64]
    </p>

    <h3> skin</h3>
    <p>
        An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The
        skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants are typically grey,
        but African elephants look brown or reddish after rolling in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches
        of depigmentation, particularly on the head. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, with the head and back
        being particularly hairy. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense
        concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the tip of the tail and parts of the head and genitals.
        Normally, the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.[65] Their
        hair is thought to help them lose heat in their hot environments.[66]

        Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive and requires mud baths to maintain moisture and
        protection from burning and insect bites. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow
        dust onto its body, which dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through
        the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a
        human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs to expose their soles to the air.[65] Elephants
        only have sweat glands between the toes,[67] but the skin allows water to disperse and evaporate, cooling
        the animal.[68][69] In addition, cracks in the skin may reduce dehydration and allow for increased thermal
        regulation in the long term.[70]
    </p>

    <h3>Legs, locomotion, and posture</h3>

        To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in
        most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have cancellous bones in place of medullary cavities. This
        strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis (blood cell creation).[71] Both the front and hind
        limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.[72] The position of the limbs
        and leg bones allows an elephant to stand still for extended periods of time without tiring. Elephants are
        incapable of turning their manus as the ulna and radius of the front legs are secured in pronation.[71]
        Elephants may also lack the pronator quadratus and pronator teres muscles or have very small ones.[73] The
        circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues, or "cushion pads" beneath the manus or pes, which allow them
        to bear the animal's great mass.[72] They appear to have a sesamoid, an extra "toe" similar in placement to
        a giant panda's extra "thumb", that also helps in weight distribution.[74] As many as five toenails can be
        found on both the front and hind feet.[33]

        Elephants can move both forward and backward, but are incapable of trotting, jumping, or galloping. They can
        move on land only by walking or ambling: a faster gait similar to running.[71][75] In walking, the legs act
        as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders moving up and down while the foot is planted on the ground. The
        fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, since there is no point where all the feet are off the
        ground, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, and can move faster by
        quickening its stride. Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their
        hind legs and can reach a top speed of 25 km/h (16 mph). At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into
        a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the
        motion of elephants and other animals.[75][76] The cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the
        pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving.[72] Elephants are capable swimmers: they can
        swim for up to six hours while completely waterborne, moving at 2.1 km/h (1 mph) and traversing up to 48 km
        (30 mi) continuously.[77]

    <h3>internal Systems</h3>
    <p>
        The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5–5.5 kg (10–12 lb) compared to 1.6 kg (4 lb) for a human brain.[78] It is
        the largest of all terrestrial mammals.[79] While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally
        smaller than the human brain. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The
        cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed, and the temporal lobes are so large that they bulge out
        laterally.[78] Their temporal lobes are proportionally larger than those of other animals, including
        humans.[79] The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use.[29]
        The larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. The vocal folds are anchored close to the
        epiglottis base. When comparing an elephant's vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant's are
        proportionally longer, thicker, with a greater cross-sectional area. In addition, they are located further
        up the vocal tract with an acute slope.[80]


        African elephant heart in a jar
        The heart of an elephant weighs 12–21 kg (26–46 lb). Its apex has two pointed ends, an unusual trait among
        mammals.[78] In addition, the ventricles of the heart split towards the top, a trait also found in
        sirenians.[81] When upright, the elephant's heart beats around 28 beats per minute and actually speeds up to
        35 beats when it lies down.[78] The blood vessels are thick and wide and can hold up under high blood
        pressure.[81] The lungs are attached to the diaphragm, and breathing relies less on the expanding of the
        ribcage.[78] Connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity. This may allow the animal to deal with
        the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air.[51]
        Elephants breathe mostly with the trunk but also with the mouth. They have a hindgut fermentation system,
        and their large and small intestines together reach 35 m (115 ft) in length. Less than half of an elephant's
        food intake gets digested, despite the process lasting a day.[78] An elephant's kidneys can produce more
        than 50 litres of urine per day.[82]

    <h3>Sex characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        A male elephant's testes, like other Afrotheria,[83] are internally located near the kidneys.[84] The penis can
        be as long as 100 cm (39 in) with a 16 cm (6 in) wide base. It curves to an 'S' when fully erect and has an
        orifice shaped like a Y. The female's clitoris may be 40 cm (16 in). The vulva is found lower than in other
        herbivores, between the hind legs instead of under the tail. Determining pregnancy status can be difficult due
        to the animal's large belly. The female's mammary glands occupy the space between the front legs, which puts the
        suckling calf within reach of the female's trunk.[78] Elephants have a unique organ, the temporal gland, located
        on both sides of the head. This organ is associated with sexual behaviour, and males secrete a fluid from it
        when in musth.[85] Females have also been observed with these secretions.[52]

    <h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
    <p>
        Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass, and roots. African elephants mostly
        browse, while Asian elephants mainly graze.[34] They can eat as much as 300 kg (660 lb) of food and drink 40 L
        (11 US gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources.[34][86] They have morning, afternoon,
        and nighttime feeding sessions. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping
        occurs at night while the animal is lying down.[86] Elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day.[87] Both males
        and family groups typically move no more than 20 km (12 mi) a day, but distances as far as 180 km (112 mi) have
        been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia.[88] Elephants go on seasonal migrations in response to changes in
        environmental conditions.[89] In northern Botswana, they travel 325 km (202 mi) to the Chobe River after the
        local waterholes dry up in late August.[90]

        Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone
        species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands;[91] smaller
        herbivores can access trees mowed down by elephants.[86] When they dig for water during droughts, they create
        waterholes that can be used by other animals. When they use waterholes, they end up making them bigger.[91] At
        Mount Elgon, elephants dig through caves and pave the way for ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds, and insects.[91]
        Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants consume and deposit many seeds over great
        distances, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination.[92] In Asian forests, large seeds require
        giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be
        filled by the smaller Malayan tapir.[93] Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can
        provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys.[91] Elephants can have a negative impact on
        ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, elephant numbers have threatened several species of
        small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight causes the soil to compress, leading to runoff and
        erosion.[86]

        Elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out of their way. Some
        aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded.[86] The size of adult elephants
        makes them nearly invulnerable to predators.[35] Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs
        in Africa[94] and tigers in Asia.[35] The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting elephants,
        targeting calves, juveniles or even sub-adults.[95][96] There are rare reports of adult Asian elephants falling
        prey to tigers.[97] Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to many
        other mammals. This may be due to elephants being less vulnerable to predation; in other mammal species,
        individuals weakened by significant parasite loads are easily killed off by predators, removing them from the
        population.[98]

<section class="SocialOrganization">
    <h2> Social organisation </h2>
    <p>
        Elephants are generally gregarious animals. African bush elephants in particular have a complex, stratified
        social structure.[99] Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups.[100]
        They are led by the matriarch, who is often the eldest female.[101] She remains leader of the group until
        death[94] or if she no longer has the energy for the role;[102] a study on zoo elephants found that the death of
        the matriarch led to greater stress in the surviving elephants.[103] When her tenure is over, the matriarch's
        eldest daughter takes her place instead of her sister (if present).[94] One study found that younger matriarchs
        take potential threats less seriously.[104] Large family groups may split if they cannot be supported by local
        resources.[105]

        At Amboseli National Park, Kenya, female groups may consist of around ten members, including four adults and
        their dependent offspring. Here, a cow's life involves interaction with those outside her group. Two separate
        families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups. During the dry season,
        elephant families may aggregate into clans. These may number around nine groups, in which clans do not form
        strong bonds but defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. The Amboseli elephant population is further
        divided into the "central" and "peripheral" subpopulations.[100]

        Female Asian elephants tend to have more fluid social associations.[99] In Sri Lanka, there appear to be stable
        family units or "herds" and larger, looser "groups". They have been observed to have "nursing units" and
        "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups, and
        possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, with only one or two adult females and their offspring. A group
        containing more than two cows and their offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have
        even smaller family units and do not reach levels above a bond group. Groups of African forest elephants
        typically consist of one cow with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other,
        especially at forest clearings.[100]


        Lone bull: Adult male elephants spend much of their time alone or in single-sex groups
        Adult males live separate lives. As he matures, a bull associates more with outside males or even other
        families. At Amboseli, young males may be away from their families 80% of the time by 14–15 years of age. When
        males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense
        forests. A dominance hierarchy exists among males, whether they are social or solitary. Dominance depends on
        age, size, and sexual condition.[106] Male elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for mates and form
        vast and fluid social networks.[107][108] Older bulls act as the leaders of these groups.[109] The presence of
        older males appears to subdue the aggression and "deviant" behaviour of younger ones.[110] The largest all-male
        groups can reach close to 150 individuals. Adult males and females come together to breed. Bulls will accompany
        family groups if a cow is in oestrous.[106]

    <h2> Intelligence and cognition </h2>
    <p>
        Elephants are among the most intelligent animals. They exhibit mirror self-recognition, an indication of
        self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins.[139] One study of a
        captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several
        visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating
        when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later.[140] Elephants are among the species known to use tools.
        An Asian elephant has been observed fine-tuning branches for use as flyswatters.[141] Tool modification by these
        animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent
        memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps which give them long lasting memories
        of their environment on a wide scale. Individuals may be able to remember where their family members are
        located.[44]

        Scientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. They are attracted to the bones of their own kind,
        regardless of whether they are related.[142] As with chimpanzees and dolphins, a dying or dead elephant may
        elicit attention and aid from others, including those from other groups. This has been interpreted as expressing
        "concern";[143] however, the Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour (1987) said that "one is well advised to study
        the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion".[144]
