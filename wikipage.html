        <p>
            Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African
            bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant
            (Elephas maximus). <br><br>
             
            They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct
            relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called
            a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is
            prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth,
            serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining
            a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave
            backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. <br><br>

            Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in
            different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay
            near water when it is accessible.<br><br>

            They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their
            environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to
            socialise. <br><br>

            Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
            related females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.
            Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males.
            Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased
            testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as
            reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers
            for as long as three years. <br><br>

            Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound;
            elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been
            compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and possibly show concern for dying and
            dead individuals of their kind.<br><br>
             
            African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as critically endangered by the 
            International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other
            threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. 
            
            Elephants are used as working animals
            in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos,
            or employed for entertainment in circuses. Elephants have an iconic status in human culture and have been
            widely featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.

<section id="etymology">
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <div class="etym">
    <p>
        The word elephant is derived from the Latin word elephas (genitive elephantis) 'elephant', which is the
        Latinised form of the ancient Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos)), probably from a
        non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. <br> <br> 
        
        It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive
        e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean
        ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal. The word elephant appears in Middle
        English as olyfaunt (c.1300) and was borrowed from Old French oliphant (12th century).

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <div class="tax">
        <p>
            Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea. Their
            closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the
            clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the
            clade Tethytheria.Three species of living elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta
            africana), forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). African elephants
            were traditionally considered a single species, Loxodonta africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as
            separate species.Mammoths (Mammuthus) are nested within living elephants as they are more closely
            related to Asian elephants than to African elephants. Another extinct genus of elephant, Palaeoloxodon,
            is also recognised, which appears to have close affinities with African elephants and to have hybridised with
            African forest elephants.

<section id="evolution">
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
<div class="evo">
    <p>
        Over 180 extinct members of order Proboscidea have been described. The earliest proboscideans, the African
        Eritherium and Phosphatherium are known from the late Paleocene. The Eocene included Numidotherium,
        Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and, some, like Moeritherium and Barytherium were probably 
        amphibious. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited more forested areas. Proboscidean 
        diversification changed little during the Oligocene. <br> <br>

        One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, which may have been
        an ancestor to several later species. A major event in proboscidean evolution was the collision of Afro-Arabia
        with Eurasia, during the Early Miocene, around 18–19 million years ago, allowing proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland across
        Eurasia and later, around 16–15 million years ago into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. <br> <br>

        Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene include the deinotheres, along with the more advanced elephantimorphs, including mammutids 
        (mastodons), gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the "shovel tuskers" like Platybelodon), choerolophodontids and stegodontids. 
        Around 10 million years ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres.
        Elephantids are distinguished from earlier proboscideans by a major shift in the molar morphology to parallel lophs rather than the cusps of earlier
        proboscideans, allowing them to become higher-crowned (hypsodont) and more efficient in consuming grass. <br> <br>

        The Late Miocene saw major climactic changes, which resulted in the decline and extinction of many proboscidean
        groups.
        The earliest members of the modern genera of Elephantidae appeared during the latest Miocene–early Pliocene
        around 5 million years ago. The elephantid
        genera Elephas (which includes the living Asian elephant) and Mammuthus (mammoths) migrated out of Africa during
        the late Pliocene, around 3.6 to 3.2 million years ago. Over the course of the Early Pleistocene, all
        non-elephantid probobscidean genera outside of the
        Americas became extinct with the exception of Stegodon, with gomphotheres dispersing into South America as part
        of the Great American interchange, and
        mammoths migrating into North America around 1.5 million years ago. At the end of the Early Pleistocene,
        around 800,000 years ago the elephantid genus
        Palaeoloxodon dispersed outside of Africa, becoming widely distributed in Eurasia. Proboscideans were
        represented by around 23 species at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene. <br> <br>

        Proboscideans underwent a dramatic decline during the Late Pleistocene as part of the Late Pleistocene
        extinctions
        of most large mammals globally, with all remaining non-elephantid proboscideans (including Stegodon, mastodons,
        and the American gomphotheres Cuvieronius
        and Notiomastodon) and Palaeoloxodon becoming extinct, with mammoths only surviving in relict populations on
        islands around the Bering Strait into the
        Holocene, with their latest survival being on Wrangel Island, where they persisted until around 4,000 years ago.
        <br> <br>

        Over the course of their evolution, probobscideans grew in size. With that came longer limbs and wider feet with
        a more digitigrade stance, along with a
        larger head and shorter neck. The trunk evolved and grew longer to provide reach. The number of premolars,
        incisors, and canines decreased, and the cheek
        teeth (molars and premolars) became longer and more specialised. The incisors developed into tusks of different
        shapes and sizes. Several species
        of proboscideans became isolated on islands and experienced insular dwarfism, some dramatically reducing in body
        size, such as the 1 m (3 ft 3 in)
        tall dwarf elephant species Palaeoloxodon falconeri.

    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <div class="skeleton"> 
        <p>
            Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. Some species of the extinct elephant genus
            Palaeoloxodon considerably exceeded modern elephants in size making them among the largest land mammals
            ever. The skeleton is made up of 326–351 bones. The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the
            backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs. The
            skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength.
            These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. By contrast, the lower jaw is dense.
            The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire
            head. The skull is built to withstand great stress, particularly when fighting or using the tusks. The
            brain is surrounded by arches in the skull, which serve as protection. Because of the size of the head, the
            neck is relatively short to provide better support. Elephants are homeotherms and maintain their average
            body temperature at ~ 36 °C (97 °F), with a minimum of 35.2 °C (95.4 °F) during the cool season, and a maximum of
            38.0 °C (100.4 °F) during the hot dry season.

    <h3> EARS & EYES </h3>
    <div class="ears">
        <img src="IMAGES/ears400x266.png" alt="elephant ears">
        <p>
            Elephant ear flaps, or pinnae, are 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) thick in the middle with a thinner tip and
            supported by a thicker base. They contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood flows into
            the capillaries, releasing excess heat into the environment. This effect is increased by flapping the ears
            back and forth. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the
            elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates and have the largest ear flaps. The
            ossicles are adapted for hearing low frequencies, being most sensitive at 1 kHz.

            Lacking a lacrimal apparatus (tear duct), the eye relies on the harderian gland in the orbit to keep it
            moist. A durable nictitating membrane shields the globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the
            location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are dichromats and they can see well in dim
            light but not in bright light.

        </div>
        <p>
            The elongated and prehensile trunk, or proboscis, consists of both the nose and upper lip, which fuse in
            early fetal development.
            This versatile appendage contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles, with no bone and little fat.
            These paired muscles consist
            of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into dorsal, ventral, and
            lateral muscles, while the
            latter are divided into transverse and radiating muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening
            in the skull. The nasal
            septum consists of small elastic muscles between the nostrils, which are divided by cartilage at the base. A
            unique proboscis
            nerve – a combination of the maxillary and facial nerves – lines each side of the appendage. <br><br>

            As a muscular hydrostat, the trunk moves through finely controlled muscle contractions, working both with
            and against each other.
            Using three basic movements: bending, twisting, and longitudinal stretching or retracting, the trunk has
            near unlimited flexibility.
            Objects grasped by the end of the trunk can be moved to the mouth by curving the appendage inward. The trunk
            can also bend at different
            points by creating stiffened "pseudo-joints". The tip can be moved in a way similar to the human hand. The
            skin is more elastic on
            the dorsal side of the elephant trunk than underneath; allowing the animal to stretch and coil while
            maintaining a strong grasp.
            The African elephants have two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow them to pluck small
            food. The Asian elephant
            has only one and relies more on wrapping around a food item. Asian elephant trunks have better motor
            coordination. <br><br>

            The trunk's extreme flexibility allows it to forage and wrestle other elephants with it. It is powerful
            enough to lift up to 350 kg (770 lb),
            but it also has the precision to crack a peanut shell without breaking the seed. With its trunk, an elephant
            can reach items up to 7 m (23 ft)
            high and dig for water in the mud or sand below. It also uses it to clean itself. Individuals may show
            lateral preference when grasping with
            their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right.[46] Elephant trunks are capable of
            powerful siphoning. They can expand
            their nostrils by 30%, leading to a 64% greater nasal volume, and can breathe in almost 30 times faster than
            a human sneeze, at
            over 150 m/s (490 ft/s). They suck up water, which is squirted into the mouth or over the body. The trunk of
            an adult Asian elephant
            is capable of retaining 8.5 L (2.2 US gal) of water. They will also sprinkle dust or grass on themselves.
            When underwater, the elephant uses
            its trunk as a snorkel.<br><br>

            The trunk also acts as a sense organ. Its sense of smell may be four times greater than a bloodhound's nose.
            The infraorbital nerve,
            which makes the trunk sensitive to touch, is thicker than both the optic and auditory nerves. Whiskers grow
            all along the trunk, and are
            particularly packed at the tip, where they contribute to its tactile sensitivity. Unlike those of many
            mammals, such as cats and rats, elephant
            whiskers do not move independently ("whisk") to sense the environment; the trunk itself must move to bring
            the whiskers into contact with nearby
            objects. Whiskers grow in rows along each side on the ventral surface of the trunk, which is thought to be
            essential in helping elephants balance
            objects there, whereas they are more evenly arranged on the dorsal surface. The number and patterns of
            whiskers are distinctly different between
            species.<br><br>

            Damaging the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have
            survived with shortened ones.
            One trunkless elephant has been observed to graze using its lips with its hind legs in the air and balancing
            on its front knees. Floppy
            trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis recorded in African bush elephants and involves the
            degeneration of the peripheral nerves
            and muscles. The disorder has been linked to lead poisoning.

    <h3> TEETH</h3>
    <div class="teeth">
        <img src="IMAGES/teeth.jpg" alt="elephant tooth">
        <p>
            Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks; 12 deciduous premolars; and 12 molars.
            Unlike most mammals, teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically. Instead, new
            teeth start at the back of the mouth and push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the
            jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. This is followed by four more tooth replacements
            at the ages of four to six, 9–15, 18–28, and finally in their early 40s. The final (usually sixth) set must
            last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are more
            diamond-shaped in African elephants.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> TUSKS</h3>
    <div class="tusk">
        <img src="IMAGES/tusk.jpg" alt="elephant tusks">
        <p>
            The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous milk teeth at
            6–12 months of age and keep growing at about 17 cm (7 in) a year. As the tusk develops, it is topped with
            smooth, cone-shaped enamel that eventually wanes. The dentine is known as ivory and has a cross-section of
            intersecting lines, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped patterns. Being living tissue,
            tusks are fairly soft and about as dense as the mineral calcite. The tusk protrudes from a socket in the
            skull, and most of it is external. At least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp, and some have nerves
            that stretch even further. Thus, it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When
            removed, ivory will dry up and crack if not kept cool and wet. Tusks function in digging, debarking,
            marking, moving objects, and fighting.<br><br>

            Elephants are usually right- or left-tusked, similar to humans, who are typically right- or left-handed. The
            dominant, or "master" tusk, is typically more worn down, as it is shorter and blunter. For African
            elephants, tusks are present in both males and females and are around the same length in both sexes,
            reaching up to 300 cm (9 ft 10 in), but those of males tend to be more massive. In the Asian
            species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all. Tuskless
            males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants. Asian males can have tusks as long
            as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was 302 cm (9 ft 11 in) long
            and weighed 39 kg (86 lb). Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa and Asia has resulted in an
            effective selection pressure for shorter tusks and tusklessness.

            An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The
            skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants are typically grey,
            but African elephants look brown or reddish after rolling in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches
            of depigmentation, particularly on the head. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, with the head and back
            being particularly hairy. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense
            concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the tip of the tail and parts of the head and genitals.
            Normally, the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart. Their
            hair is thought to help them lose heat in their hot environments. <br><br>

            Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive and requires mud baths to maintain moisture and
            protection from burning and insect bites. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow
            dust onto its body, which dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through
            the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a
            human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs to expose their soles to the air. Elephants
            only have sweat glands between the toes, but the skin allows water to disperse and evaporate, cooling
            the animal. In addition, cracks in the skin may reduce dehydration and allow for increased thermal
            regulation in the long term.

    <h3>LEGS, LOCOMOTION, & POSTURE</h3>

        <p>
            To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in
            most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have cancellous bones in place of medullary cavities. This
            strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis (blood cell creation). Both the front and hind
            limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front. The position of the limbs
            and leg bones allows an elephant to stand still for extended periods of time without tiring. <br> <br>

            Elephants are incapable of turning their manus as the ulna and radius of the front legs are secured in
            pronation. Elephants may also lack the pronator quadratus and pronator teres muscles or have very small ones. The
            circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues, or "cushion pads" beneath the manus or pes, which allow them
            to bear the animal's great mass. They appear to have a sesamoid, an extra "toe" similar in placement to
            a giant panda's extra "thumb", that also helps in weight distribution. As many as five toenails can be
            found on both the front and hind feet. <br><br>

            Elephants can move both forward and backward, but are incapable of trotting, jumping, or galloping. They can
            move on land only by walking or ambling: a faster gait similar to running. In walking, the legs act
            as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders moving up and down while the foot is planted on the ground. The
            fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, since there is no point where all the feet are off the
            ground, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, and can move faster by
            quickening its stride. <br><br>

            Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their
            hind legs and can reach a top speed of 25 km/h (16 mph). At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into
            a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the
            motion of elephants and other animals. The cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the
            pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving. Elephants are capable swimmers: they can
            swim for up to six hours while completely waterborne, moving at 2.1 km/h (1 mph) and traversing up to 48 km
            (30 mi) continuously.

    <h3>INTERNAL SYSTEM</h3>

        </div>
        <p>
            The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5–5.5 kg (10–12 lb) compared to 1.6 kg (4 lb) for a human brain. It is the
            largest of all
            terrestrial mammals. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller than the human
            brain. At birth,
            an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The cerebrum and cerebellum are well
            developed, and the temporal
            lobes are so large that they bulge out laterally.[78] Their temporal lobes are proportionally larger than
            those of other animals,
            including humans. The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later
            use. The larynx
            of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. The vocal folds are anchored close to the epiglottis
            base. When comparing an
            elephant's vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant's are proportionally longer, thicker, with a greater
            cross-sectional area.
            In addition, they are located further up the vocal tract with an acute slope. <br> <br>

            The heart of an elephant weighs 12–21 kg (26–46 lb). Its apex has two pointed ends, an unusual trait among
            mammals. In addition, the
            ventricles of the heart split towards the top, a trait also found in sirenians.[81] When upright, the
            elephant's heart beats around
            28 beats per minute and actually speeds up to 35 beats when it lies down. The blood vessels are thick and
            wide and can hold up
            under high blood pressure. The lungs are attached to the diaphragm, and breathing relies less on the
            expanding of the ribcage.
            Connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity. This may allow the animal to deal with the pressure
            differences when its
            body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air. Elephants breathe mostly with the trunk
            but also with the mouth.
            They have a hindgut fermentation system, and their large and small intestines together reach 35 m (115 ft)
            in length. Less than half of an
            elephant's food intake gets digested, despite the process lasting a day. An elephant's kidneys can produce
            more than 50 litres of urine per day.
